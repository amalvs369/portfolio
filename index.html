                <p>Hello! I'm Amal, Hi! I'm a B.A. English Literature graduate with a passion for creativity, storytelling, and digital design. While my academic background has honed my communication, critical thinking, and writing skills, I’ve also developed a strong interest in web development — especially front-end design using HTML and CSS.

Combining my literary sensibility with technical skills, I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web pages. I’m eager to grow as a developer and explore how language and technology can work together to create meaningful digital experiences.</p>

                <p>Hello! I’m AMAL, a B.A. English Literature graduate with a keen interest in both the written word and web development. My academic journey in literature has not only refined my analytical and critical thinking abilities but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the art of storytelling, narrative structure, and human expression.

However, my passion doesn’t stop at literature. As I explored the world of digital media, I became captivated by the possibilities of creating content that lives and breathes online. This led me to develop strong skills in HTML and CSS, tools that allow me to blend my literary background with creative digital design. I enjoy crafting intuitive, visually appealing, and responsive websites that tell a story and engage users.

In a constantly evolving digital landscape, I believe that understanding both content and code is essential. My goal is to merge the worlds of language and technology to create seamless, functional, and aesthetic web experiences that not only look good but also communicate effectively.

Whether it's through writing compelling content or designing user-friendly web pages, I am dedicated to continuously learning, improving my technical skills, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the digital space.
                As I embark on this journey, I am fueled by the belief that with hard work, persistence, and a passion for learning, anything is possible. This is just  thebeginning of my story, and I am excited to see where this path takes me.</p>
